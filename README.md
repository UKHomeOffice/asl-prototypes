```
git clone git@github.com:UKHomeOffice/asl-prototypes.git
cd asl-prototypes
npm install
```

## Running the prototype locally:

```
npm start
```

Or, if you're changing things and want the code to stay up to date in the browser:

```
npm run dev
```

In both cases, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in a browser and see the prototype.
