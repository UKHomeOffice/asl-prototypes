# asl-prototypes

This is a collection of HTML prototypes for user research and templates of common pages and patterns in the Animals in scientific procedures e-licensing (ASPeL) service.

It was orginially created from an previous version of the Home Office prototype kit (the latest version of which is available at https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/get-started/start-prototype). Due to the age of the prototype, it requires Node v10.X.X.


## Installation

Download the prototype from https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/asl-prototypes

Navigate to /asl-prototypes

Run "npm install" install

To start the prototype run "node start"

The prototype will then be visible on http://localhost:3000

## Notes

The prototype authentication typically needs to be disabled when testing with users on POISE machines. The relevant code to be disabled is flagged in a comment in the server.js file.
