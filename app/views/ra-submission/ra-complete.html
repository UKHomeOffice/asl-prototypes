A key benefit of this programme of work is the provision of safety data to facilitate sound regulatory decisions when assessing the risks to which humans, animals, plants or the environment are exposed when test substances are produced, transported or used.

The studies conducted during the course of this licence have been to support the development of new medicinal products, chemicals, plant protection products, biocides, food and feed additives and medical devices. These studies have, individually or as a programme of work, contributed to the regulatory approval of many test items with respect to human safety.

Over the 5-year course of this licence, approximately 300 studies have been conducted using rats and mice and the reports submitted for scientific and regulatory review. Out of these, 34 studies identified substances that may have the potential to cause DNA damage in humans.

        <textarea class="govuk-textarea" id="more-detail" name="more-detail" rows="16" aria-describedby="more-detail-hint">In assessing the endpoints, the principal harms to the animals arise mainly due to procedural activities such as dosing (mostly by the oral route), hypodermic needle insertion (for blood sampling and/or dosing) and restraint, as well as from potential toxicity of a test material. Procedural activities were generally very quick, resulting in only momentary discomfort and from which the animals fully recovered. A small proportion of studies included longer restraint, to which the animals were gradually acclimatised, or surgical preparation for long-term intravenous infusion. Surgical procedures were performed under general anaesthesia and included post-operative analgesia to minimise pain and antibiotics to reduce infection risks. Overall, approximately 90% of the animals experienced no more than moderate effects from the test material and/or procedural activities. A small number (less than 10%) of animals experienced severe effects. When these occurred, animals were immediately euthanased when necessary, to prevent the authorised Project Licence severity banding being breached.</textarea>

        <textarea class="govuk-textarea" id="more-detail" name="more-detail" rows="8" aria-describedby="more-detail-hint">The testing strategies employed are directly driven by statutory regulatory requirements of UK, European and other worldwide authorities. The requirements of these authorities are constantly reviewed but over the course of the licence there was no scope for replacement of in-vivo animal models with alternative methodologies. The studies authorised by the licence referenced in this review occurred after in vitro testing had already been performed.

        </h3>
        <textarea class="govuk-textarea" id="more-detail" name="more-detail" rows="8" aria-describedby="more-detail-hint">Study designs followed regulatory requirements and were routinely kept at the minimum size commensurate with achieving those goals. Multiple investigations, e.g end points for micronucleus assessments and DNA strand breaks, are built into the studies to maximise the information obtained from each animal, reducing the need for additional studies in more animals. The introduction of blood microsampling techniques have been incorporated, whenever possible, into studies to reduce the numbers of animals needed for evaluate test material exposure.
                  
        A repository containing blood samples from a limited number of animals treated with a substance known to cause DNA damage, is used when the tissue of interest is peripheral blood. This replaces the requirement for a concurrent positive control group in each study.

  Refinement
  </label>
</h3>
<textarea class="govuk-textarea" id="more-detail" name="more-detail" rows="15" aria-describedby="more-detail-hint">Most evidence of overt toxicity occurred in range finder studies involving small numbers of animals and led to immediate refinement of dose levels and/or study designs, such that fewer adverse effects will have been experienced by the animals on any subsequent studies.
          
Close partnership with our clients promotes an adaptive/reactive science-led approach to study conduct. Combined with due diligence and literature review/research with respect to anticipation of adverse effects and appropriate dose selection, we strive to refine our study designs to minimise the number of animals experiencing more than mild to moderate effects. Wherever possible procedures are combined to achieve multiple scientific end/data points from a single activity (e.g. blood sampling to provide samples for multiple endpoints/analyses).
