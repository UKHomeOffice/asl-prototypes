      <p>
        Using the latest imaging technologies, e.g. cine-magnetic resonance (MRI) – including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging- we strive to maximize the information obtained from each animal during the same imaging study. Detection of subtle cardiac changes in mice treated with new compounds which would potentially be missed by conventional imaging and by accurately detecting changes in infarct size and cardiac haemodynamics and reducing the ‘noise’ in the dataset, this allows us to use fewer animals than before to identify differences between the treated group and the control group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refined use of primary cell cultures, the number of mice being required to be humanely killed to generate clones has been reduced from 30 to 10 by incubating cells in ‘hypoxic conditions’ to improve cloning efficiency. The number of cells needed for our analytical procedure has been reduced by the establishment of robust methods for single-cell measurements of gene expression.
