        Studies of putative adult cardiac stem cells in mouse myocardium has successfully identified cells with robust clone-forming ability and multi-lineage potential that are able to convert into cardiac muscle, vascular smooth muscle, or endothelium after grafting to the heart, and which improve cardiac pump function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Major achievements relating to this BHF- and MRC-funded work include: Pinpointing which among the many classes of cardiac stromal cell has reproducible stem cell properties; defining the cells' molecular signature by single-cell qPCR and their embryological origin by Cre/lox fate-mapping; systematically investigating the properties of cloned adult cardiac stem cells (single-cell derivatives) and proving their fidelity to freshly isolated cells; showing that stem cell grafting helps prevent heart failure after experimental myocardial infarction, even though just 10-20 cells engraft durably; demonstrating that signals secreted by the adult cardiac stem cells can reduce human cardiac muscle cell death, using simulated myocardial infarction in tissue culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, our Wellcome Trust-funded drug discovery programme to create small-molecule inhibitors of enzyme of interest has achieved: determining the compounds' pharmacokinetics and establishing conditions suitable for proof-of-concept testing in vivo; proving that this enzyme inhibition reduces infarct size by roughly 70%, if given prophylactically before ischemia-reperfusion; proving, further, that enzyme inhibition reduces infarct size by roughly 70%, even if given two hours after injury, reducing muscle cell death from both apoptosis and necrosis.
