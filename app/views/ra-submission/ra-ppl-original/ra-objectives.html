              </h3>
              <p>
                The aim of this project is to provide quality scientific data to support the development and marketing of safe medicines for both human and veterinary use, and to make sure that chemicals that the population may be exposed to (like industrial chemicals and pesticides) are safe to be used by the general public too. We will mainly test if these substances are safe in the cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) and respiratory (lungs) systems. We will also be testing new and potentially better drugs for important conditions like high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat, and asthma, to see if they work better and have less side effects compared to existing drugs. As part of this we will be seeing how much of these drugs are in the blood after we dose them to animals, because if there is not enough there, they simply won't have the effect we want.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of the data we generate will be sent to the regulators who will then decide if the chemicals we test are fit for exposure to humans, or if the new drugs we test are safe to be given to humans for the first time.
