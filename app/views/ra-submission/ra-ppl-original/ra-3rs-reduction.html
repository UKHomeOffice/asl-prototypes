            <p>
              The experiments we perform are only permitted on the condition we use the least number of animals possible to get a meaningful result to assess safety or whether a drug has the desired effect. These numbers are sometimes based on a number set by a regulator, or based on our own experience. We regularly consult with statisticians when new study types are performed. They do a special calculation (power calculation) which takes into account the size of likely effect we will see to help determine the number of animals we use. Although we do use the least number of animals possible, its important to use enough animals to get a meaningful result, otherwise we would end up using more animals overall than we needed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we can we only use one control group per study (effectively dosed with the drug formulation without the drug in it) which acts as a baseline to compare any effect of the drug itself. We also try not to use extra animals to compare an existing drug (which we know provides an effect in the experimental model) where possible. We also re-use animals where this does not adversely impact on the welfare of the animal concerned (see the sections above) and this reduces the overall numbers of animals we use too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studies are also carefully designed to combine the different aspects needed to evaluate the safety or whether a drug has its effect combined, and again this reduces the overall numbers of animals used.
