                    <p>Intratracheal administration: poor recovery from anaesthesia is a potential adverse effect that may occur immediately after the procedure. Cessation of breathing is also a possible adverse effect.</p>
        
                    <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>
        
                    <p>Lung tumours: administration will result in the growth of lung tumours (90%) depending on the transgene and drug combination.</p>
        
                    <p>Clinical signs of lung cancer include laboured breathing, inactivity, piloerection, persistently hunched posture, unresponsive behaviour and weight loss.</p>

                    <p>Intratracheal administration: The procedure will be performed by experienced technicians. Following the procedure, animals will be monitored closely for 30 minutes. If animals show signs of poor recovery from anaesthesia such as severe respiratory distress, slow respiration, it will be killed immediately. If the animals stop breathing we will perform thoracic massage, if this is unsuccessful, the animals will be killed immediately.</p>
        
                    <p>Anaesthesia: During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>
        
                    <p>Lung tumours: All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical signs that necessitate intervention. Regular assessment and scoring system for breathing pattern, behaviour and weight loss will be carried out to ensure that the adverse effects are limited (see details for clinical signs chart and score sheet in general humane endpoints section).</p>
        
                    <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines.

              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

              <p>Repeated Imaging: Animals will not be anaesthetised for more than 10 h in any week. If an animal is to be anaesthetised more than once in a day this should last no longer than 1 h at a time and should not exceed 2 h in one day. Repeated anaesthesia will only be carried out once the animal has fully recovered from the previous anaesthesia. Longer anaesthesia’s of up to 3 h may be performed only once a day and over 3 h will be terminal.</p>

                    <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>
        
                    <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days. </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

Internal bleeding will be monitored with ultrasound during and after the procedure and the extent of haemorrhage will be assessed for 5 minutes. Signs of internal bleeding such as abdominal distention, pale and cold extremities will be monitored hourly for the first 3 hours and close monitoring will be carried out for the first 24 hours after the procedure.

              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days. </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                    <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains.  </p>
        
                    <p>Skin incisions: require wound closure which can breakdown requiring re-closure. There is also a low possibility of wound infection or herniation. </p>
        
                    <p>Bleeding: Excessive bleeding can occur during surgery and resection.</p>
        
                    <p>Pancreatitis: Animals will develop symptoms of pancreatitis, including fatigue, altered feeding patterns and reduced exercise including grooming. The animals will continue to respond to stimuli, to feed and maintain their weight. </p>

During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>
        
                    <p>Skin incisions: Wounds will be checked daily after surgery for signs of infection such as persistent bleeding, dehiscence or herniation. Incisions maybe re-sutured once in the event of suture breakdown, provided that the wound is uninfected and uninflamed.</p>
        
                    <p>Bleeding: Careful dissection will be carried out to prevent extensive tissue damage. Gentle pressure using sterile gauze will be applied to stop minor bleeding. Diathermy will be used to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding.</p>
        
                    <p>All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical  signs that necessitate intervention (see example clinical observation). </p>

                    Body weight will be monitored twice a week and any mice showing a 10% weight loss (compared with baseline) will be monitored daily. If they experience 15% loss (in total) over 48 hours, they will be humanely killed.
                    
                    The animals will be killed at the end of the experimental procedure when the scientific objective has been achieved.

              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                    <p>Administration of agents that induce tissue damage or cancer: Mutagens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) will induce changes in the DNA and will subsequently result in tumour formation, however the injection of mutagen does not produce any significant effects to the animals. Agents that induce tissue damage may lead to weight loss. This weight loss is transient and typically animals recover within a week after cessation of treatment. </p>
        
                    <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>
                    
                    <p>Oral gavage: Any mice receiving repeated oral gavage could possibly be miss-dosed (immediate dyspnoea) or damage could occur to the oesophagus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mammary tumour: Large tumours at mammary gland may affect normal movement or become ulcerated. Tumours may possess a potential to spread to multiple sites (common tropism to lung, liver, bone and brain). </p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"  style="margin-bottom: 5px;">How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-procedure maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>
        
                    <p>Administration of substance: If animals show evidence of abdominal pain on i/p injection then injections will be stopped. Mice will be monitored daily and any animal showing pain related behaviours, including writhing or abdominal pressing will be killed. If these problems occur in a number of mice, the dose and frequency of the substance will be reviewed. </p>
                    
                    <p>Oral gavage: Oral administrations will be monitored for signs of miss-dosing or damage to  the oesophagus such as blood on the canula, hunched back or piloerection. </p>
                    
                    <p>Mammary tumour: Mice are closely monitored for health state and tumour size, particularly in relation to the position in the body: for instance tumour close to the neck or the genitals are allowed to develop less compared to tumours on the flank.</p>
                    
                    <p>When monitoring tumour growth, the size of superficial tumours will be regularly assessed using callipers. For a mouse carrying a single tumour, the mean diameter will generally not exceed 1.5 cm and 1.8 cm for metastatic or therapeutic study. Where multiple tumours are in evidence, the mean diameter of the largest tumour should not exceed 15 mm provided that there are no additional adverse welfare consequences for the animal.</p>
                    
                    <p>All animals will be weighed weekly and monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical  signs that necessitate intervention (see example clinical observation and score sheet). </p>
                    
                    <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines. Mice will be culled when the experimental postulation is evidenced and scientifically validated in an accurate manner according to guidelines that minimise the suffering to the animals.</p> 
                    
                    <p>In addition, we will utilise the humane endpoints to ensure that the dverse effects are limited. </p>

              <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 5: Imaging of tissues<span class="reuse-flag">repeated from protoccol 3</span></h3>
              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

              <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>
              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                    <p>Adverse effects will primarily relate to drug-induced toxicity, and since agents and treatment regimens may have not previously been studied in vivo, toxic effects will be unpredictable both in terms of nature and incidence. </p>
        
                    <p>Some of the most common drug induced adverse effects are weight loss, piloerection, persistently hunched posture and prolonged episodes of subdued behaviour even if provoked, and/or clinical signs of suffering like persistently laboured respiration (dyspnea), or persistent diarrhoea. </p>

                    <p>Animals will be dosed early during the day so that any acute adverse effects can be monitored during the working day and evidence of recovery from any adverse effects established. </p>
        
                    <p>Athymic animals are prone to hypothermia after drug administration so they will be placed on a heat pad to aid recovery. </p>
                    
                    <p>Animals will be weighed at the start of dosing and then at least twice weekly.</p>
                    
                    <p>Animal distress will be minimised by close monitoring for acute effects in the first hours after administration, twice daily monitoring throughout the first 4 days of drug administration and thereafter by daily inspection. </p>
                    
                    <p>Animals will be closely monitored in the immediate post-dosing period and an acute toxicity observation chart will be used - see below</p>
