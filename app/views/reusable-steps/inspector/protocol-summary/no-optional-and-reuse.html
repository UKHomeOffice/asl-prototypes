                  <p>Intratracheal administration: poor recovery from anaesthesia is a potential adverse effect that may occur immediately after the procedure. Cessation of breathing is also a possible adverse effect.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>

                  <p>Lung tumours: administration will result in the growth of lung tumours (90%) depending on the transgene and drug combination.</p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of lung cancer include laboured breathing, inactivity, piloerection, persistently hunched posture, unresponsive behaviour and weight loss.</p>

                  <p>Intratracheal administration: The procedure will be performed by experienced technicians. Following the procedure, animals will be monitored closely for 30 minutes. If animals show signs of poor recovery from anaesthesia such as severe respiratory distress, slow respiration, it will be killed immediately. If the animals stop breathing we will perform thoracic massage, if this is unsuccessful, the animals will be killed immediately.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>

                  <p>Lung tumours: All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical signs that necessitate intervention. Regular assessment and scoring system for breathing pattern, behaviour and weight loss will be carried out to ensure that the adverse effects are limited (see details for clinical signs chart and score sheet in general humane endpoints section).</p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines. Mice will be culled when the experimental postulation is evidenced and scientifically validated in an accurate manner according to guidelines that minimise the suffering t the animals. </p>

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  Repeated Imaging: Animals will not be anaesthetised for more than 10 h in any week. If an animal is to be anaesthetised more than once in a day this should last no longer than 1 h at a time and should not exceed 2 h in one day. Repeated anaesthesia will only be carried out once the animal has fully recovered from the previous anaesthesia. Longer anaesthesia’s of up to 3 h may be performed only once a day and over 3 h will be terminal.

                  <p>Mutagens such as AOM will induce changes in the DNA and will subsequently result in tumour formation, however the injection of mutagen does not produce any significant effects to the animals. </p>

                  <p>Agents that induce tissue damage like DSS treatment may lead to weight loss. This weight loss is transient and typically animals recover within a week after cessation of treatment. Mice may also exhibit transient symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or bloody stools for no more than 24 h.</p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of intestinal tumour growth are palpable abdominal mass, bloody stools, anaemia, extended stomach and diarrhoea.</p>

                  <p>Any mice receiving repeated oral gavage could possibly be miss-dosed (immediate dyspnoea) or damage could occur to the oesophagus.</p>

                  <p>All animals will be checked daily for persistent signs of ill health such as, hunched posture, dehydration and unresponsive behaviour. </p>

                  <p>DSS treated mice will be monitored continuously for at least 5 minutes and body weight at least once per day for a week.</p>

                  <p>If a mouse shows signs of distress after substance administration, all subsequent dosing will be stopped. If these problems occur in a number of mice, the dose and frequency of the substance will be reviewed.</p>

                  <p>Oral dosing performed by skilled staff, observation for signs of damage / miss-dosing. </p>

                  <p>Intestinal tumours: All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical signs that necessitate intervention. Regular assessment and scoring system for abdominal mass, changes in defecation and weight loss will be carried out to ensure that the adverse effects are limited (see details for clinical signs chart and score sheet in general humane endpoints section).</p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines. Mice will be culled when the experimental postulation is evidenced and scientifically validated in an accurate manner according to guidelines that minimise the suffering t the animals.</p>

                  <p>Obvious miss-dosing during oral gavage will result in immediate euthanasia.</p>

                  <p>Mice showing any unexpected harmful phenotype unrelated to colitis-associated CRC will be culled.   </p>

                  <p>If the animals exhibit signs of severe intestinal damage (chronic diarrhoea, bloody stools for more than 24 hours, rectal prolapse) they will be culled immediately. In addition, any animal exhibiting general signs of distress, marked piloerection, persistently hunched posture and prolonged episodes of subdued behaviour even if provoked. Body weight will be monitored twice a week and any mice showing a 10% weight loss (compared with baseline) will be monitored daily. If they experience 15% loss (in total) over 48 hours, they will be humanely killed..</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days. </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  Repeated Imaging: Animals will not be anaesthetised for more than 10 h in any week. If an animal is to be anaesthetised more than once in a day this should last no longer than 1 h at a time and should not exceed 2 h in one day. Repeated anaesthesia will only be carried out once the animal has fully recovered from the previous anaesthesia. Longer anaesthesia’s of up to 3 h may be performed only once a day and over 3 h will be terminal.

                  <p>Any mice receiving repeated oral gavage could possibly be miss-dosed (immediate dyspnea) or damage could occur to the oesophagus.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>

                  <p>Intrapancreatic injection via laparotomy: Skin incisions require wound closure which can breakdown requiring re-closure. There is also a low possibility of wound infection or herniation. </p>

                  <p>There will be no additional adverse effect due to ultrasound-guided intrapancreatic injection.</p>

                  <p>Pancreatic tumour: Administration will result in the growth of pancreatic tumours depending on the transgene and drug combination. Clinical signs of pancreatic cancer include weight loss, marked abdominal distension, inactivity, piloerection, persistently hunched posture, jaundice and unresponsive behaviour.</p>

                  <p>Substances used will be well known and safe dose levels determined in advance. However, if mouse shows signs of distress after substance administration, all subsequent dosing will be stopped. If these problems occur in a number of mice, the dose and frequency of the substance will be reviewed</p>

                  <p>Any mice receiving repeated oral gavage, will be monitored for signs of miss-dosing or damage to the oesophagus such as blood on the canula, hunched back or piloerection.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-operative maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>

                  <p>Intrapancreatic injection via laparotomy: Injection volume will typically not exceed 0.2ml. Animals will receive peri- and postoperative analgesia and all surgical procedures will be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the LASA Guiding Principles for Preparing and Undertaking Aseptic Surgery. Skin incisions wounds will be checked daily after surgery for signs of infection such as persistent bleeding, dehiscence or herniation. Incisions maybe re-sutured once in the event of suture breakdown, provided that the wound shows no sign of infection or inflammation and occurs within 48 hours post surgery. In the event of post-operative complications, animals will be killed unless, in the opinion of the NVS, such complications can be remedied promptly and successfully using no more than minor interventions.</p>

                  <p>Pancreatic tumour: All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical signs that necessitate intervention. Regular assessment and scoring system for abdominal mass, distension and weight loss will be carried out to ensure that the adverse effects are limited (see details for clinical signs chart and score sheet in general humane endpoints section). </p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines. Mice will be culled when the experimental postulation is evidenced and scientifically validated in an accurate manner according to guidelines that minimise the suffering t the animals. </p>

                  <p>Caerulein is an oligopeptide that causes acinar cell death and subsequent inflammation. Although the animals are well tolerated to the injection regimens, animals may experience abdominal pain from intraperitoneal injection and intermittent weight loss (up to 15% in comparison with weight prior to procedure). Mice may be hunched and less active post injection but is expected to recover promptly.</p>

                  <p>The dose of caerulein to induce pancreatitis is well established and safe dose levels determined in advance. However, if mouse shows signs of distress after substance administration, all subsequent dosing will be stopped.</p>

                  <p>If animals show evidence of abdominal pain on intraperitoneal injection then injections will be stopped. Pain and distress will be assessed by the grimace scale (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/mouse-grimace-scale) and by observation for abdominal pressing. Injection site is rotated to minimise effect of multiple injections. Analgesia will be administered in consultation with the NVS</p>

                  <p>At times pancreatitis develops quicker as expected. In those circumstances the injections are stopped.</p>

                  <p>Animals will receive peri- and post-procedure analgesia.</p>

                  <p>Infection: In order to prevent introducing infection and animal distress, LASA Good Practice Guidelines will be followed including aseptic procedures such as shaving the hair, disinfecting the skin, using sterile and disposable biopsy needle. Signs of infection such as red and inflamed area where biopsy needle is introduced, general signs of animal distress such as hunched position, piloerection and lack of movement will be monitored daily for the first 7 days after the procedure.   </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-procedure maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>

                  <p>Internal bleeding: The respiration rate and heart rate will be monitored during the procedure. Internal bleeding will be monitored with ultrasound during and after the procedure and the extent of haemorrhage will be assessed for 5 minutes. Signs of internal bleeding such as abdominal distention, pale and cold extremities will be monitored hourly for the first 3 hours and close monitoring will be carried out for the first 24 hours after the procedure. Gentle external pressure using sterile gauze or other haemostatic agents (e.g fibrin gel) will be applied on the area where biopsy needle is introduced to stop minor bleeding. </p>

                  <p>Body weight will be monitored twice weekly.</p>

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days. </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated.

Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  <p>Repeated Imaging: Animals will not be anaesthetised for more than 10 h in any week. If an animal is to be anaesthetised more than once in a day this should last no longer than 1 h at a time and should not exceed 2 h in one day. Repeated anaesthesia will only be carried out once the animal has fully recovered from the previous anaesthesia. Longer anaesthesia’s of up to 3 h may be performed only once a day and over 3 h will be terminal.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-operative maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.  </p>

                  <p>Skin incisions: Wounds will be checked daily after surgery for signs of infection such as persistent bleeding, dehiscence or herniation. Incisions maybe re-sutured once in the event of suture breakdown, provided that the wound is uninfected and uninflamed.</p>

                  <p>Bleeding: Careful dissection will be carried out to prevent extensive tissue damage. Gentle pressure using sterile gauze will be applied to stop minor bleeding. Diathermy will be used to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding.</p>

                  <p>All animals will be monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical  signs that necessitate intervention (see example clinical observation). </p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of pancreatitis such as reduced grooming, altered feedng patterns will be monitored daily.</p>

                  In addition, any animal exhibiting more general signs of distress, marked piloerection, persistently hunched posture and prolonged episodes of subdued behaviour even if provoked, persistent diarrhoea or dyspnoea will be culled.

                  Body weight will be monitored twice a week and any mice showing a 10% weight loss (compared with baseline) will be monitored daily. If they experience 15% loss (in total) over 48 hours, they will be humanely killed.

                  The animals will be killed at the end of the experimental procedure when the scientific objective has been achieved. Humane endpoint is after 12 months (full regeneration and remodelling of the pancreas) or earlier (intermediate time points of tissue remodelling).

                  In the event of intra-operative or post-operative complications, the animal will be culled, unless in consultation with the NVS such complications can be promptly rectified using minor interventions.

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Administration of agents that induce tissue damage or cancer: Mutagens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) will induce changes in the DNA and will subsequently result in tumour formation, however the injection of mutagen does not produce any significant effects to the animals. Agents that induce tissue damage may lead to weight loss. This weight loss is transient and typically animals recover within a week after cessation of treatment. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>

                  <p>Oral gavage: Any mice receiving repeated oral gavage could possibly be miss-dosed (immediate dyspnoea) or damage could occur to the oesophagus.</p>

                  <p>Mammary tumour: Large tumours at mammary gland may affect normal movement or become ulcerated. Tumours may possess a potential to spread to multiple sites (common tropism to lung, liver, bone and brain). </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-procedure maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Administration of substance: If animals show evidence of abdominal pain on i/p injection then injections will be stopped. Mice will be monitored daily and any animal showing pain related behaviours, including writhing or abdominal pressing will be killed. If these problems occur in a number of mice, the dose and frequency of the substance will be reviewed. </p>

                  <p>Oral gavage: Oral administrations will be monitored for signs of miss-dosing or damage to  the oesophagus such as blood on the canula, hunched back or piloerection. </p>

                  <p>Mammary tumour: Mice are closely monitored for health state and tumour size, particularly in relation to the position in the body: for instance tumour close to the neck or the genitals are allowed to develop less compared to tumours on the flank.</p>

                  <p>When monitoring tumour growth, the size of superficial tumours will be regularly assessed using callipers. For a mouse carrying a single tumour, the mean diameter will generally not exceed 1.5 cm and 1.8 cm for metastatic or therapeutic study. Where multiple tumours are in evidence, the mean diameter of the largest tumour should not exceed 15 mm provided that there are no additional adverse welfare consequences for the animal.</p>

                  <p>All animals will be weighed weekly and monitored daily for signs of ill health and assessed for clinical  signs that necessitate intervention (see example clinical observation and score sheet). </p>

                  <p>Clinical signs of tumour growth coupled with whole body imaging will be used to detect and visualise cancer development and will be monitored following NCRI guidelines.

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains. </p>

                  <p>Hair removal: may cause skin irritation. </p>

                  <p>Skin incisions: require wound closure which can breakdown requiring re-closure. There is also a low possibility of wound infection or herniation. </p>

                  <p>Animals will receive peri- and postoperative analgesia and all surgical procedures will be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the LASA Guiding Principles for Preparing and Undertaking Aseptic Surgery (2010).</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: Peri and post-operative maintenance of body temperature by appropriate thermostatically controlled incubators or by other heat sources will occur. During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes) until they have fully returned to normal.  Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered. Animals will receive appropriate analgesia during and after surgery.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Skin incisions:  Wounds will be checked daily after surgery for signs of infection such as persistent bleeding, dehiscence or herniation. Incisions maybe re-sutured once in the event of suture breakdown, provided that the wound show no signs of infection or inflammation. </p>

                  <p>Bleeding: Careful dissection will be carried out to prevent extensive tissue damage. Gentle pressure using sterile gauze will be applied to stop minor bleeding. Diathermy will also be used to cauterizeblood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding.          </p>

                  <p>Animals which show signs of more severe effects such as body weight loss of 10% over a 24hr period or loss of 15% of body weight (compared to baseline weights) that persists for 48hrs or serious clinical signs such as marked piloerection, persistently hunched posture and prolonged episodes of subdued behaviour even if provoked will be immediately killed.</p>

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: adherence to recommended anaesthesia methods should prevent fatalities, but they could occur as there are some differences in the susceptibility of all normal, mutant, and transgenic rodent strains.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: may cause skin irritation.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: no particular problems are associated with imaging or the injection of imaging agents for MRI, ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging. </p>

                  <p>SPECT/CT and PET/CT involves exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays which are potentially harmful.</p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Imaging of tissues involving the following optional regulated procedures: </p>

                  <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>

                  <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>

                  <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>

                  <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>

                  <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>

                  <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>

                  <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>

                  <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>

                  <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

                  <p>Anaesthesia: During imaging procedures the vital signs of the mice are always monitored carefully, and steps taken to ensure they are properly supported during longer procedures, e.g.the administration of isotonic solutions hourly to keep them properly hydrated. Body temperature will be maintained and monitored during general anaesthesia using thermostatically controlled heating pads, microwaveable gels or warm air blowers.</p>

                  <p>During anaesthesia and recovery animals will be kept under constant observation until they regain their righting reflex and will then be monitored at regular intervals (every 15 minutes)until they have fully returned to normal. </p>

                  <p>Animals will not be re-anaesthetised unless fully recovered.</p>

                  <p>Hair removal: Small animal clippers will be cleaned between each use.</p>

                  <p>Imaging: The exposure to the use of X-rays AND/OR radiotracers that emit gamma-rays will beat the lowest possible dose, i.e., trace amounts, whilst still obtaining valid imaging data. Following administration of radioactive probes, mice body conditioning scoring and weight will be assessed weekly to identify changes in weight, posturing, coat and behaviour. Animals showing 10% weight loss will be assessed daily. </p>

                  <p>Adverse effects will primarily relate to drug-induced toxicity, and since agents and treatment regimens may have not previously been studied in vivo, toxic effects will be unpredictable both in terms of nature and incidence. </p>

                  <p>Some of the most common drug induced adverse effects are weight loss, piloerection, persistently hunched posture and prolonged episodes of subdued behaviour even if provoked, and/or clinical signs of suffering like persistently laboured respiration (dyspnea), or persistent diarrhoea. </p>

                  <p>Animals will be dosed early during the day so that any acute adverse effects can be monitored during the working day and evidence of recovery from any adverse effects established. </p>

                  <p>Athymic animals are prone to hypothermia after drug administration so they will be placed on a heat pad to aid recovery. </p>

                  <p>Animals will be weighed at the start of dosing and then at least twice weekly.</p>

                  <p>Animal distress will be minimised by close monitoring for acute effects in the first hours after administration, twice daily monitoring throughout the first 4 days of drug administration and thereafter by daily inspection. </p>

                  <p>Animals will be closely monitored in the immediate post-dosing period and an acute toxicity observation chart will be used - see below</p>
