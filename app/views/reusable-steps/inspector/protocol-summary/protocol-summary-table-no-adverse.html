              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies. These are not expected to have an adverse biological effect.</p>
              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
              <p>NB. Blood samples will generally be taken at the same time points as the imaging sessions (under the same anaesthesia) and will be used to assess the concentration (% injected dose) of radioactivity in the blood. </p>

              <p>Repeated Imaging: Animals will not be anaesthetised for more than 10 h in any week. If an animal is to be anaesthetised more than once in a day this should last no longer than 1 h at a time and should not exceed 2 h in one day. Repeated anaesthesia will only be carried out once the animal has fully recovered from the previous anaesthesia. Longer anaesthesia’s of up to 3 h may be performed only once a day and over 3 h will be terminal.</p>

              <p>a. In the case of 18FDG-PET/CT, animals may be fasted overnight (max 14 hours), with free access to water. 18FDG is a glucose analogue and fasting is required as a standard to control for glucose metabolism prior to imaging (AA).</p>
              <p>b. Animals will be placed under general anaesthesia generally use gaseous anaesthetic, for example isoflurane (AB).</p>
              <p>c. Animals may have an area of hair shaved using an electric small animal shaver AND/OR hair removal cream prior to ultrasound, photoacoustic or optical imaging (AB, AC).</p>
              <p>d. Animals will receive an injection of labelling or contrast agents via intraperitoneal (AA/AB/AC) or intradermal (AB/AC) or intravenous injection prior to scanning (AA/AB/AC), or via a temporary indwelling cannula implanted intravenously (AB/AC). Commercially available imaging agents will be used that have a safe history of usage, biologically neutral agents (quantum dots), or antibodies.

              <p>e. Animals may be scanned using dedicated preclinical imaging platforms (AB):</p>
              <p>MRI, Micro-CT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustics, Optical</p>
              <p>Restraint may be used to minimize movement (without affecting respiration) to improve image quality especially in MRI which is extremely motion sensitive. Animals will be monitored (may include ECG via electrodes) for the maintenance of physical stability (temp, respiration etc.).</p>
              <p>f. Blood samples by venipuncture via one of the following routes - tail vein or saphenous vein may be done after injection of nuclear tracers (AA, AB). No more than 10% circulating blood volume will be removed within a 24 hour time period and no more than 15% of the blood volume in any 28 days.  </p>
