        <p>Health concerns due to the developing high tumour burden, including weight loss, anaemia, poor feeding behaviour, decreased locomotion, difficult breathing, and ascites (~50%)</p>
        <p>"</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?</h3>
        <p>"Pain during or after injection will be minimised by careful dosing of anaesthetics and analgesia. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Animals will receive analgesics (e.g., carprofen, buprenorphine) and other pre-medication (e.g., dexamethasone and atropine for prevent inflammation and reduce oedema). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. Post-injection analgesia will be given for at least 48 hours and as required afterwards.</p>
        <p>Injection complications will be minimised by ultrasound guidance, careful dosing of anaesthetics, maintenance of body temperature during the injection procedure and fluid therapy. Body weight will be monitored following the injection until animals recover their pre-injection weight. Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 min will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. If, in rare cases, severe internal bleeding is detected, the mouse will be killed. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers. Additional physiological monitoring may include heart rate and blood pressure measurements via surface or subcutaneous electrodes, neither of which are expected to cause adverse effects. If the procedure lasts for more than 60 min, a subcutaneous injection of saline will be given to rehydrate the animal.</p>
        <p>Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water </p>
        <p>Post-injection complications will be minimised by using aseptic technique and close monitoring of animal recovery. Normally animals recover fully within 24 h and afterwards show no visible adverse effects to the described procedures. Animals will be checked frequently for signs of pain, distress or disease. If the animal does not recover within 3 h post-injection, it will be killed. </p>
        <p>Health concerns due to the developing tumour and metastases.  Because the majority of the animals within this protocol will develop tumours following the injection of tumorigenic cells, adverse effects on the animals’ welfare may arise from substantial tumour growth in the liver. Approximately 70% of animals will show clinical signs of moderate severity. In addition, some tumours may metastasise to sites that are distant from the primary. To minimise the impact of the tumour, animals will be monitored closely for signs of pain or distress and weighed weekly. The body condition score (Ullman-Culleré and Foltz, Lab Anim Sci. 1999;49(3):319-23) will also be evaluated along with the weighing. Tumour size will be measured by non-invasive imaging (such as ultrasound, contrast CT, MRI, etc.) twice weekly when necessary. Clinical signs related to liver failure, including jaundice, oedema, will also be closely monitored for."</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are the humane endpoints for this step?</h3>
        <p>"1. If the tumour growth negatively impacts normal physiological functions, e.g., eating, drinking and grooming, the animal will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).</p>
        <p>2. If internal bleeding develops after the injection, the animal will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).</p>
        <p>3. As the disease progresses and extensive liver tumours are established, impaired liver function leading to bloody ascites will be noted. If the animal develops ascites, it will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia). </p>
        <p>4. Animals exhibiting any unexpected harmful phenotypes, such as hunched posture, piloerection, or decrease in activity for more than 24 h, or loss >15% body weight (in growing animals, compared to age matched controls) will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia), or in the case of individual animals of particular scientific interest, advice will be sought promptly from the NVS.</p>
        <p>5. In case of infection, the NVS will be consulted and, if appropriate, antibiotics will be administered. If this procedure is not successful, the experiment will be terminated and the animal humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).</p>

          How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?
          Adverse effect of the administered substance: substance administration is expected to result in no more than transient discomfort and no lasting harm. Mice will be monitored upon returning to their cage, with the expectation that they move and interact with cage mates normally. In the cases where agents are administered via food or drinking water, the mice from the same treatment group will be housed together, and will be monitored for abnormal weight change and dehydration. The regular body condition scoring will be applied for proper monitoring, in addition to body weight measuring.

        <p>"Pain during or after surgery will be minimised by careful dosing of anaesthetics and peri-operative analgesia. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Animals will receive pre-operative analgesics (e.g., carprofen, buprenorphine) and other pre-medication (e.g., dexamethasone and atropine for prevent inflammation and reduce oedema). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. Post-surgical analgesia will be given at least for 48 h post-surgery and as required afterward.</p>
        <p>Surgical complications will be minimised by good surgical techniques, careful dosing of anaesthetics, maintenance of body temperature during surgery and fluid therapy. Body weight will be monitored following surgery until animals recover their pre-surgical weight. Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 mins will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. If, in rare cases, severe internal bleeding is detected, the mouse will be killed. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers. Additional physiological monitoring may include heart rate and blood pressure measurements via surface or subcutaneous electrodes, neither of which are expected to cause adverse effects. If the procedure lasts for more than 60 min, a subcutaneous injection of saline will be given to rehydrate the animal.</p>
        <p>Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water. </p>
        <p>Post-surgery complications will be minimised by using aseptic technique and close monitoring of animal recovery.

        <p>Bone marrow transplantation prior to tumour induction: Animals may be irradiated (typically once but occasionally with two sub lethal doses) (AA) or may receive a haematopoietic stem cell depleting reagent, e.g. busulfan, intraperitoneally (AA). Subsequently they will be reconstituted with haematopoietic cells (e.g., from bone marrow or foetal liver) via the intravenous or intraperitoneal routes (AA). These cells may have been previously infected in vivo with viral vectors to express genes of interest.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are the likely adverse effects of this step?</h3>
        <p>"Adverse effects of cell type ablation (< 10%)</p>
        <p>Irradiation or treatment with a stem cell depleting reagent is expected to cause no more than transient discomfort. The resulting transient immune suppression may occasionally result in infections or in colitis. The expression of genes from viral vectors is not expected to cause any adverse effects, but these are not always predictable."</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?</h3>
        <p>Adverse effects of cell type ablation: Doses of 10 Gy or more will be given as a split dose to minimise gastrointestinal toxicity and mice will be monitored for the appearance of clinical signs related to colitis including diarrhoea, bloody stools, rectal prolapse, abdominal discomfort, bloating and weight loss. These symptoms are most likely to occur 2 to 4 weeks following irradiation, thus monitoring will be more frequent during this period. After 4 weeks the mice are not expected to show any adverse effects. Mice will be monitored for unexpected side effects such as infections, lack of normal movement or other abnormal behaviour. Mice will be maintained in barriered facilities. The risk of infection may be reduced by providing antibiotics in drinking water (AA), via oral gavage (AA), or the intraperitoneal (AA), intravenous (AA), or subcutaneous routes (AA). Since this step will be performed prior to tumour induction, the animals will be allowed to rest for at least 4 weeks after transplantation to allow full recovery from the irradiation, before tumour induction can be performed.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?</h3>
        <p>"Body weight change will be monitored by weighing mice on several consecutive days after acute food restriction for up to 12 h is applied before the imaging session. Occasionally, studies may require the animal diet to be altered in order to remove extraneous signal generation, so the animals will be weighed twice a week throughout the longer period of diet change until their body weight is stable relative to controls. The move from standard chow to the altered diet will be gradual in order to allow the animals to get accustomed to the new diet. The specific food pellets will be commercially available and approved for use both externally and through the named NACWO and/or NVS. When a new composition is used, or a combination with any other treatment, pilot experiments (2–4 animals) may be performed with weighing at least once in 2 days. The treatment will be stopped if the pilot group does not tolerate the combination of the altered diet and treatment. The introduction of new diets will be progressive for a better success of animals accepting them.</p>
        <p>Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water </p>
        <p>Adverse effects of anaesthesia will be minimised by careful dosing of the anaesthetic, maintenance of body temperature during the procedure and fluid therapy. General anaesthesia will be necessary as physical restraint and immobility will be required for imaging. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. </p>
        <p>Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 min will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers. Additional physiological monitoring may include heart rate and blood pressure measurements via surface or subcutaneous electrodes, neither of which are expected to cause adverse effects. If an imaging session lasts for more than 60 min, a subcutaneous injection of saline will be given to rehydrate the animal.</p>
        <p>Total anaesthesia during an imaging session after which the animals will be recovered will last no longer than 4 h, however it will typically be much less than this (~ 1 h). Animals will not undergo more than one imaging session per day (usually only one per week), however if they need to be anaesthetised more than once per day (for example, if a non-imaging related procedure is followed by an imaging session), they will be fully recovered and displaying normal behaviour, eating, drinking, and showing no evidence of hypothermia or dehydration, before being re-anaesthetised. Use of any other form of anaesthesia, i.e. injectable agents, will only be conducted after advice from the NVS and NACWO. On completion of a recovery imaging session, animals will be monitored until righting reflex and normal behaviour are observed. If anaesthesia was prolonged, the animal will be placed in a heated recovery chamber until normal behaviour is observed. Analysis may be repeated on the same animal but typically this will not exceed three sessions within a week period. Any imaging agent used to enhance contrast or allow imaging will in most cases be commercially available, and will always have a safe history of usage. As such, imaging agents are not expected to have any adverse effects.  In this protocol, the maximum number of imaging sessions will be25</p>
        <p>Adverse effects of imaging </p>
        <p>MRI: the use of non-ionising radio-frequency waves during novel MRI protocols can very occasionally cause heating. Scans will be terminated immediately if there is a sudden increase in temperature (>1 °C/min) due to r.f. or gradient heating effects, and scan parameters will be modified accordingly. </p>
        <p>µCT: MicroCT imaging uses X-ray radiation. However, the delivered dose per scan is sufficiently low so that no adverse effects are to be expected even after repeated scans.</p>
        <p>SPECT and PET: both modalities require the use of radiotracers that emit gamma-rays and/or X-rays. This exposure to radiation is potentially harmful, however the doses used to obtain valid imaging data are minimal and will be kept as low as possible; as such no adverse effects are expected through routine use. Animals will be monitored for any signs of discomfort or distress caused by administration of any radioactive probes. </p>

For example, animals treated with chemotherapy may have diarrhoea, coat change, weight loss; brequinar may cause immunosuppression; drugs targeting the nervous system may induce behavioural changes such as increased or decreased locomotion, circular behaviour or excessive grooming. In most cases, In the case of novel therapeutics, pilot experiments will be done to determine maximum tolerated dose.

        <p>"Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water. </p>
        <p>Pain during or after surgery will be minimised by careful dosing of anaesthetics and peri-operative analgesia. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Animals will receive pre-operative analgesics (e.g., carprofen, buprenorphine) and other pre-medication (e.g., dexamethasone and atropine for prevent inflammation and reduce oedema). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. Post-surgical analgesia will be given at least for 48 hours post-surgery and as required afterwards.</p>
        <p>Surgical complications will be minimised by good surgical techniques, careful dosing of anaesthetics, maintenance of body temperature during surgery and fluid therapy. Body weight will be monitored following surgery until animals recover their pre-surgical weight. Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 min will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers. Additional physiological monitoring may include heart rate and blood pressure measurements via surface or subcutaneous electrodes, neither of which are expected to cause adverse effects. If an imaging session lasts for more than 60 min, a subcutaneous injection of saline will be given to rehydrate the animal. If, in rare cases, severe internal bleeding is detected, the mouse will be killed.</p>
        <p>Post-surgery complications will be minimised by using aseptic technique and careful monitoring of wound healing. Normally animals will recover fully within 24 h and afterwards show no visible adverse signs due to the implanted window. Recovery of the animals will be monitored closely, and they will be checked frequently for signs of pain, distress or disease. </p>
        <p>Discomfort due to the presence of the foreign body cannot be fully eliminated, but previous experience has shown that following recovery, operated animals carrying abdominal window implant can perform normal movements of the body and should not display any significant signs of discomfort. Any animal that has not shown adaptation to the device within 48 h after implantation will be referred to the NVS for advice. Animals with implants will be monitored closely for signs of pain or distress (e.g. ruffled coat, piloerection, excessive urination/defecation, hunched posture, shivering, laboured gait, enhanced breathing frequency). The duration of experiments with animals carrying abdominal windows will be limited to 3 months."</p>

        <p>Control animals and mice for pilot experiments, which may be GA or WT, will not develop tumours but may receive injections of control cells or Matrigel only."</p>

        <p>"Skin irritation from depilating agents used for hair removal (< 5%)</p>
        <p>While no incisions will be made during the procedure, hair removal might be performed for better visualization purpose. No adverse effect is expected through the use of clippers, however hair removal using depilating agents may cause skin irritation. </p>
        <p>Adverse effects of the injection procedure, such as pain and eye drying (< 5%)</p>
        <p>Under normal practice, this results in minimal anaesthesia-related fatality (≤1%), however this is a possibility.</p>
        <p>Health concerns due to the developing tumour and metastases, including weight loss, tumour ulceration, poor feeding behaviour, and difficult breathing (~ 70%). </p>
        <p>Because the majority of the animals within this protocol will develop tumours following the injection of tumorigenic cells or spontaneously, after ~2 months of age, adverse effects on the animals’ welfare may arise from substantial mammary primary tumour growth. In addition, some tumours may metastasise to sites that are distant from the primary, particularly, the lung. Approximately 70% of animals on this protocol will therefore show clinical signs of moderate severity. In the majority of therapeutic experiments, tumours will not exceed the mean diameter of 1.5 cm, and when multiple tumours will be present, the cumulative size will not exceed this maximum. The only exception will be the metastasis experiments (up to 20% of the total number of mice in this protocol), which may require the primary tumour to grow to the size with the mean diameter of 2 cm. For most of the animals, we do not expect to see anything more than subtle changes in the clinical condition or behaviour of the animals."</p>

In addition, animals will be weighed weekly and if they start to show signs of weight loss, they will be weighed every 48 h. The body condition score (Ullman-Culleré and Foltz, Lab Anim Sci. 1999;49(3):319-23) will also be evaluated along with the weighing.

        <p>
          The agents to be administered will have already been used by others and therefore, appropriate dosing information will be available.

          How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?
          Adverse effect of the administered substance: substance administration is expected to result in no more than transient discomfort and no lasting harm. Mice will be monitored upon returning to their cage, with the expectation that they move and interact with cage mates normally. In the cases where agents are administered via food or drinking water, the mice from the same treatment group will be housed together, and will be monitored for abnormal weight change and dehydration. The regular body condition scoring will be applied for proper monitoring, in addition to body weight measuring.

        <p>"Pain during or after surgery will be minimised by careful dosing of anaesthetics and peri-operative analgesia. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Animals will receive pre-operative analgesics (e.g., carprofen, buprenorphine) and other pre-medication (e.g., dexamethasone and atropine for prevent inflammation and reduce oedema). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. Post-surgical analgesia will be given at least for 48 hours post-surgery and as required afterward.</p>
        <p>Surgical complications will be minimised by good surgical techniques, careful dosing of anaesthetics, maintenance of body temperature during surgery and fluid therapy. Body weight will be monitored following surgery until animals recover their pre-surgical weight. Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 mins will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. If, in rare cases, severe internal bleeding is detected, the mouse will be killed. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers. Additional physiological monitoring may include heart rate and blood pressure measurements via surface or subcutaneous electrodes, neither of which are expected to cause adverse effects. If the procedure lasts for more than 60 min, a subcutaneous injection of saline will be given to rehydrate the animal.</p>
        <p>Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water. </p>
        <p>Post-surgery complications will be minimised by using aseptic technique and close monitoring of animal recovery. Normally animals recover fully within 24 h and afterwards show no visible adverse effects to the described procedures. Animals will be checked frequently for signs of pain, distress or disease.

        <p>Control animals and mice for pilot experiments, which may be GA or WT, will not develop tumours but may receive injections of control cells or Matrigel only.</p>

        <p>"While no incisions will be made during the procedure, hair removal might be performed for better visualization purpose. No adverse effect is expected through the use of clippers, however hair removal using depilating agents may cause skin irritation. </p>
        <p>Adverse effects of the injection procedure, such as pain and damage to the pancreas (< 5%)</p>
        <p>Under normal practice, the injection procedure results in minimal anaesthesia-related fatality (≤1%), however this is a possibility.</p>
        <p>Post-injection complications, such as infection, pancreas rupture and internal bleeding (< 5%)</p>
        <p>Health concerns due to the developing tumour and metastases, including weight loss, hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, ascites (~50%)</p>
        <p>For the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models (~80% of all animals with tumours):</p>
        <p>About 50% of the animals with tumours will likely develop metastases. Possible adverse effects include some hindrance to motion. Mice may develop paralysis in their hind legs. Animals showing minor hindrance to their mobility will be monitored daily and killed if difficulties feeding or moving around the cage are observed. </p>
        <p>For the PanNET models (~20% of all animals with tumours):</p>
        <p>About 95% of the animals with tumours will likely develop hypoglycaemia as the tumours progress, as a result of the insulin secretion from the cancer cells. Possible adverse effects include hypolocomotion and hypothermia. In rare cases (<2%), mice may develop paralysis in their hind legs. "</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How will you monitor for, control, and limit any of these adverse effects?</h3>
        <p>"Skin irritation will be minimised by applying depilating agents for the minimal time required for hair removal and by thorough cleaning of the skin with water</p>

If the animal does not recover within 3 h post-injection, it will be killed. </p>
        <p>Health concerns due to the developing tumour and metastases: To minimise the impact of the tumour, animals will be monitored closely for signs of pain or distress (e.g. ruffled coat, piloerection, excessive urination/defecation, loss of appetite, inactivity, hunched posture, shivering, enhanced breathing frequency). Weight will also be monitored in experiments in which metastasis to internal organs is expected. If a decrease of 10% of body weight is detected, monitoring will be performed daily. Laboured breathing will also be monitored for where lung metastasis is expected. The body condition score (Ullman-Culleré and Foltz, Lab Anim Sci. 1999;49(3):319-23) will also be evaluated along with the weighing. Tumour size will be measured by non-invasive imaging (such as ultrasound, contrast CT, MRI, etc.) twice weekly when necessary. </p>
        <p>Particular care will be taken to ensure detection of unexpected sites of tumour development. As with all internal tumour sites, this will include clinical examination, measurement of body weight, abdominal palpation and loss of condition. Reliance will be placed on the general condition of the animal, together with assessment of palpable tumours and specific signs such as hind limb weakness or paralysis. </p>
        <p>In experiments with the pancreatic neuroendocrine models, the mice will be supplied with sugar supplements (including sugar pellets and/or water) after tumours develop, in order to decrease the chance of hypoglycaemia. In mice experiencing hypothermia as a result of hypoglycaemia, additional soft bedding, such as Sizzle Nest, will be provided; in addition, cages with hypothermic animals may be placed into IVC racks with increased environmental temperature.</p>
        <p>Finally, some tumours may cause cachexia and sarcopenia and testing for gait and other aspects of motor function may be employed. Tumour burden will be limited to the minimum required for a valid scientific outcome. Therapeutic studies will be designed to avoid the need for control tumours to be excessively large. "</p>

        <p>2. Animals that display moderate clinical signs such as marked piloerection, persistently hunched posture and unresponsive behaviour to extraneous activity or provocation, and/or clinical signs of suffering like persistently laboured respiration (dyspnoea), or persistent diarrhoea will be killed immediately.  </p>

        <p>Pain during or after the injection will be minimised by careful dosing of anaesthetics and peri-operative analgesia. General anaesthesia will be induced using an agent and route appropriated for mouse age and weight of the animal (e.g., inhalational isoflurane or intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine). Depth of anaesthesia will be carefully monitored by following the rate and depth of respiration and by checking the pinch reflex. </p>
        <p>Injection complications will be minimised by the use of aseptic techniques, careful dosing of anaesthetics, maintenance of body temperature during surgery and fluid therapy. Any animal anaesthetised for more than 5 mins will have eye lubricant (e.g., viscotears) applied to stop the eyes drying and becoming irritated. If, in rare cases, severe internal bleeding is detected, the mouse will be killed. For mice under prolonged anaesthesia (> 15 min) physiological monitoring will be used to assess the respiration rate and core body temperature. If a rectal probe is used to measure body temperature, an appropriate lubricant (e.g., KY jelly) will be used. Animal temperature will be maintained via thermostatically regulated stages, electrically heated pads, hot water tubing, and/or warm air blowers.</p>
        <p>Post-injection complications will be minimised by using aseptic technique and close monitoring of animal recovery. Normally animals recover fully within 24 h and afterwards show no visible adverse effects to the described procedures. Animals will be checked frequently for signs of pain, distress or disease. If the animal does not recover within 3 h post-injection, it will be killed. </p>
        <p>Health concerns due to the developing tumour and metastases: To minimise the impact of the tumour, animals will be monitored closely for signs of pain or distress (e.g. ruffled coat, piloerection, excessive urination/defecation, loss of appetite, inactivity, hunched posture, shivering, enhanced breathing frequency). Weight will also be monitored in experiments in which metastasis to internal organs is expected. If a decrease of 10% of body weight is detected, monitoring will be performed daily. Laboured breathing will also be monitored for where lung tumours are expected. </p>
        <p>Brain metastases may lead to neurological problems, including left hemiparesis or in the worst case, tumour dissemination via cerebrospinal fluid can cause rapid deterioration of behaviour and cognition. Mice will be monitored daily for neurological deficits, such as difficulties in locomotion or unusual responses to changes in their environment or disturbed consciousness. Onset of neurological deficit in an animal would be indicated by early signs of ataxia (gait, posture and muscle tone deficits), as well as motor control and coordination abnormalities (loss of muscle control).  Such animals would be placed under close observation protocols and would be killed if early stage paralysis symptoms are noted (rigidity of one or both posterior limbs or the back or moderate reduction in the tone of rear limb musculature) or if other, more general signs of deterioration in health are noted such as weight loss or loss of body condition.</p>
        <p>In addition to brain metastasis, the animals could potentially develop bone and liver metastases as well. The animals will be monitored for limb deformity, postural change, decreased motility, signs of pain and even fracture and paralysis, as potential signs of bone metastases development. The animals will also be monitored for hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, anaemia, as potential signs of liver metastases. </p>
        <p>If a decrease of 10% of body weight or a deteriorated body condition is detected, monitoring will be performed daily. The body condition score (Ullman-Culleré and Foltz, Lab Anim Sci. 1999;49(3):319-23) will also be evaluated along with the weighing. Tumour size will be measured by non-invasive imaging (such as IVIS, ultrasound, contrast CT, MRI, etc.) twice weekly when necessary. "</p>
        <p>"1. If the animal shows signs of brain metastases (including seizure, posture change, abnormal behaviours or other neurological signs), or signs of bone metastases (including pain which could not be relieved, fracture or paralysis), or signs of liver metastases (including ascites, jaundice, anaemia), the animals will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).</p>
        <p>2. If in rare cases, severe internal bleeding or arrhythmia followed by hemodynamic shock is noted, the mouse will be immediately killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation under terminal anaesthesia). </p>
        <p>3.If the animal suffers from less severe complications derived from the intracardiac injection procedure, such as embolism, and shows signs of dyspnea, weakness, decreased motility, paralysis, etc., and does not recover within 3 h, the animal will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).</p>
        <p>4. If the tumour growth negatively impacts normal physiological functions, e.g., eating, drinking and grooming, the animal will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia). </p>
        <p>
          5. If the body condition score drops to <2, the animal will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia).
          
          6. Animals exhibiting any unexpected harmful phenotypes, such as hunched posture, piloerection, or decrease in activity for more than 24 h, or loss >15% body weight (in growing animals, compared to age matched controls) will be humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia), or in the case of individual animals of particular scientific interest, advice will be sought promptly from the NVS.
        </p>
        <p>7. In case of infection, the NVS will be consulted and, if appropriate, antibiotics will be administered. If this procedure is not successful, the experiment will be terminated and the animal humanely killed (Schedule 1 or via decapitation or perfusion under terminal anaesthesia)."</p>
