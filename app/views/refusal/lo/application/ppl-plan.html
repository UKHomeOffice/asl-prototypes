        <p>
          In a certain proportion of adults, especially those that are untreatable with current medications, there is a risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in adults. The aetiology of this condition is not fully understood, but there is the possibility that neurological dysfunction associated with the epileptic fits may lead to cardiorespiratory failure. Our aim is to understand the mechanisms by which epileptic fits could compromise the function of cardio respiratory neurons which in turn could lead to SUDEP, and to look at new treatments that could prevent it from happening.

        SUDEP
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Identifying the brainstem circuits affected by acute and chronic seizures in freely-behaving animals
      </p>

      <p>
        In vitro studies of brainstem slices from mutant mice susceptible to seizures show that a self-propagating depolarizing wave can silence cardiorespiratory neuronal networks (Aiba and Noebels, 2015. Sci Transl Med 7: 282ra246). SUDEP is caused by cardiorespiratory arrest, which most likely arises from seizure-induced spreading depolarisation affecting the operation of critical cardiorespiratory nuclei in the brainstem. We shall use our in vivo imaging methods therefore to identify: i) the cardiorespiratory nuclei that are disrupted by seizures; and ii) whether acute and chronic seizures have different disruptive effects on the relevant brainstem circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Breathing has three phases: inspiration, post-inspiration, and active expiration respectively generated by the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), the post-inspiratory complex (PiCo), and the lateral parafacial nucleus (retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN)). Disruption of any one of these nuclei could disrupt breathing and result in terminal apnoea. Cardiovascular function is set by excitatory rostral ventrolateral medullary neurons in the brainstem, which are influenced by caudal ventrolateral medullary inhibitory neurons. We shall therefore image and analyse the activity of neurons in key brainstem respiratory (e.g. RTN, PiCo or preBötC) and cardiovascular (e.g. caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla) nuclei during acute and chronic seizures in mice.
      </p>

      <p>
        i) Genetically encoded calcium indicators such as GCaMP6 will be introduced into key cardiorespiratory autonomic nuclei via viral transduction driven by neuron-specific promoters such as synapsin.
      </p>

      <p>
        ii) A GRIN optical fibre, a cannula for injection of convulsants such as kainic acid (KA) into brain areas such as the amygdala or hippocampus and EEG-ECG electrodes will be implanted unilaterally, followed by implantation of the baseplate to secure the camera. 
      </p>

      <p>
        iii) To study the effect of acute seizures on cardiorespiratory circuit and understand the function of these neurons during silent period (typically 5-30 days after acute seizures) before development of chronic spontaneous seizures and during chronic spontaneous seizures, mice will be induced with status epilepticus. KA (typically 0.2-0.4 μg in 50nl) will be injected through the cannula to induce the status epilepticus (acute seizures) and its effects on cardiorespiratory circuit will be studied during acute seizures. Mice will undergo acute seizures for a continuous period >3 h if untreated, but seizures will be stopped after a period of no longer than 60 minutes with anticonvulsants such as lorazepam (6-12mg/kg), diazepam (20 mg/kg) or ketamine (50 mg/kg), which may be given in combination. Seizures will be scored intermittently using a modified Racine scale. To study the effect of acute seizures through the development of chronic seizures, mice will be recorded every week until the development of chronic spontaneous seizures (around 5-30 days after acute seizures). We will confirm chronic seizures and record the activity of neurons from cardiorespiratory autonomic nuclei in response to induced electrographic seizures (e.g. by administering a lower dose of KA, 0.02-0.04 μg in 50nl, through cannula) during chronic epilepsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        During acute and chronic seizures and silent period neuronal Ca2+ imaging, EEG-ECG recording (seizure class and frequency, cardiovascular changes such as PR and QT intervals), breathing responses (WBP changes, tidal volume, breathing frequency and pattern) and neuronal responses to changes in inspired CO2 will be performed at pre-, during- and post-KA or vehicle intrahippocampal injection in the pharmacologically-induced seizure model. Post-hoc histology study will be performed to analyse the changes in microglial morphology (surveilling/activated). 
      </p>

      <p>
        2. The role of microglia in altering the activity of key cardiorespiratory neurons affected by acute and chronic seizures
      </p>

      <p>
        We will record the effects of pharmacological microglial activation/inhibition either before or after acute seizures on the activity pattern of cardiorespiratory neurons during acute and chronic seizures in mice. By targeting cardiorespiratory nuclei that we have identified, we shall test whether microglial activation/inhibition in these nuclei progressively alters the activity of these neurons. Using the methods of the previous section, we shall record neurons in the identified cardiovascular and respiratory nuclei during microglial activation or inhibition before acute or chronic seizures. Microglia will be respectively activated or inhibited with, for example, lipopolysaccharide (i.p.) or minocycline treatment, before the induction of acute or chronic seizures. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If inhibition of microglia is found to be effective in maintaining the activity of cardiorespiratory networks during chronic seizures, then immediate clinical intervention could be provided to prevent SUDEP by using the commonly prescribed antibiotic, minocycline, which crosses the blood brain barrier to block microglial activation.

        Project interdependencies and milestones
      </h3>

      <p>
        Objective 1 key milestones. 1) Documenting the invasion of a seizure into one of the key cardiorespiratory brainstem nuclei. 2) Observing the effects of seizures on cardiorespiratory control becomes more profound with time. 3) Correlating these changes in cardiorespiratory control over time with altered invasion of seizures into the brainstem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Objective 2 key milestones. Documenting that microglial activation/inhibition: 1) alters cardiorespiratory responses during the transition from acute to chronic seizures; 2) reduces the frequency of seizure initiation; 3) alters the invasion into, and effects of seizures on, the cardiorespiratory nuclei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interdependencies: Milestone 1 and 2 of objective 2 are independent of objective 1, and will be valuable to document whether all milestones of objective 1 are achieved or not. Milestone 3 of objective 2 depends on establishing the key milestones of objective 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mitigations: given that there is overwhelming evidence that cardiorespiratory control is catastrophically altered in SUDEP, if we do not find that the milestones of objective 1 are met with our initial choice of brainstem nuclei (which represent our first "best" choice for the targets of seizures), we shall extend our investigation to further important nuclei such as Kolliker Fuse and locus coeruleus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Companion in vitro work: 
      </p>

      <p>
        We plan complementary in vitro immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments to study the functional changes in microglia (their morphology and structure) following induction of seizures in the acute and chronic phases. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If we can document that seizures will reliably invade a particular brainstem nucleus, and that this alters over time during the chronic phase of epilepsy, we will create an in vitro model that can recapitulate the essence of this. This model will likely involve cutting brainstem slices that encompass the relevant nucleus from mice in the control, acute and chronic phases of epilepsy, performing electrophysiological and/or imaging measurements from the slices, and subjecting them to powerful imposed excitation via pharmacological methods. If we can replicate our observations in a reduced model of this type, it would be very useful to examine in mechanistic detail the synaptic and cellular properties that change during the phases of epilepsy and how microglia in the slice impact on these changes. However we need to establish the phenomenon in vivo first, to be able to create a suitable and informative in vitro model that can test specific mechanistic hypotheses.

        Where relevant, how will you seek to use or develop non-animal alternatives for all or part of your work?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Wherever possible we shall use isolated/cultured tissue or cells for in vitro experiments. However to achieve the aims of this project, which depend on understanding how seizures from cortical regions of the brain invade the brainstem and alter cardiorespiratory networks, reduced in vitro models do not adequately recapitulate the structures and circuitry that we need to study.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neural network modelling of the cardiorespiratory networks has not progressed to a point where these models would have useful predictive value, or could be used to support new therapetuic interventions in patients. Furthermore such models would have to encompass the connectivity from the hippocampus (focus of seizure origin) to the brainstem. Currently, the levels of knowledge to create suitable predictive models is lacking.
