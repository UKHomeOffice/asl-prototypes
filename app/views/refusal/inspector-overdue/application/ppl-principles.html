        2)	Build on inadequately powered prior studies to provide definitive testing of hypotheses.

        3)	Demonstrate the establishment of a model system to replicate a disease condition prior to commencing a series of novel experimental studies.

        Why will you use animals of a single sex in some protocols or experiments?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We will initially use just males to reduce potential oestrus cycle-dependent variability. This will allow robust observations which we will then extend to females to ensure generalisability of results.
