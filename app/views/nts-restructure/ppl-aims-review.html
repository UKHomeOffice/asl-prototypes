          We will investigate in a systematic manner to meet our objectives:
        </p>
          
        <p>
          1. Establish whether age at exposure to ionising radiation affects likelihood of cardiovascular disease development.
        </p>
                  
        <p>
          2. Discover whether drugs can reduce the development of atherosclerosis following radiation exposure.

        <P>
          Cardiovascular disease is one of the most common cause of death in developed world. The main cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, which is a swelling inside the wall of blood vessels (plaque) causing obstruction to blood flow that may result in heart attack or stroke.
        </P>

        <P>
          Exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease development and there is some evidence that age at exposure may affect this risk. However, this has been shown in cultured cells and it is unknown if a whole animal would respond in the same way. There are also drugs that we have shown to reduce early stage development of atherosclerosis in cultured cells, but again it is not known if these effects will be seen in the complexity of a whole organism.
