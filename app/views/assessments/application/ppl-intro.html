          In the UK, around 600,000 people – almost 1% of the population – have epilepsy. Of these people with epilepsy approximately 600 die every year from SUDEP. Many more people have to live daily with the risk of SUDEP hanging over them. Whilst it is known that seizure-induced cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunction is a potential cause of SUDEP, identification of effective therapies to prevent SUDEP is hampered by poor understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms that lead to seizure-induced cessation of breathing and/or circulation. Improved knowledge of microglial activation or inhibition in regulating cardiorespiratory function and seizure threshold/frequency will help to inform the future development of therapeutic interventions. Developments in therapeutic care will ultimately benefit the patients, clinicians and the health care system. It will reduce the duration of hospitalization and disabilities due to uncontrolled seizures in patients with epilepsy and reduce suffering of their family members, and improve the quality of life in lessening concerns over seizures and SUDEP. We hope that in the longer term, the UK health care system will benefit by saving money and resources spent on epilepsy patients.
