        Typically, what will be done to an animal used in your project?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The majority of animals within this project will administered test agents as a single administration or daily administration for up to 4 weeks. At various time-points animals will be observed for physiological or behavioural changes (e.g. body temperature, anxiety, exploration, social interaction, learning and memory, reaction to a stimulus). Blood samples may be taken on occasion so that test agent exposure levels or biomarkers of disease can be determined and related to the human situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        These assessments may be conducted in normal animals, animals genetically susceptible to emotion state disorders, or animals which have various emotional states induced chemically. Animals assigned to protocols which require them to learn to lever press in order to obtain a positive reward (e.g. sugar pellet) have an extended duration or several months which is largely determined by how quickly the animals learn the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all cases, upon completion of testing the animals are humanely killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The endpoints will be carefully selected based on the purpose of the study and by considering the effect that each test may have on the outcome of another test or on multiple testing. In general, each observation (test) is of short duration (e.g. 15 minutes). Examples of study designs based on therapeutic purpose are as follows;

        What are the expected impacts and/or adverse effects for the animals during your project?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Humane endpoints (documented within the licence) will be applied to animals used under the protocols specified in this licence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these studies are typically conducted at the early stage of drug development and often for lead optimization purposes, preliminary toxicology and or pharmacokinetic studies are anticipated to have been performed and as such the dose levels can be carefully selected in order to avoid undue toxicity. The majority of the protocols within this licence are behaviorally based and as such adverse effects are not desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
        These assessments may be conducted in normal animals, animals genetically susceptible to emotion state disorders, or animals which have various emotional states induced chemically. In the majority of cases, the resultant effects will not be obvious, with animals appearing normal. However, under certain conditions, such as a test which requires the animal to remember a task, to interact with another animal, respond to a novel environment or response to an auditory stimulus, the genetic or chemically-induced phenotype may be revealed. Such effects are also anticipated for positive controls used within this project licence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If overt effects are seen, then these are anticipated to be transient and will typically be stimulant- or sedative-like.

        What are the expected severities and the proportion of animals in each category (per animal type)?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The severity limit specified (moderate) is considered to be the minimum commensurate with achieving study objectives. For the majority of studies conducted under this licence, the severity limit is moderate due to the procedures required to achieve the protocol objectives. Repeat dosing and multiple subthreshold and mild procedures are primarily responsible for the moderate severity imposed. In the majority of cases animals will not experience more than mild signs as a result of administration of the test agents. Marked effects anticipated are primarily those related to the known pharmacology of drugs e.g. sedation or stimulation.
